"Acne is a common skin condition where the pores of your skin become blocked by hair, sebum (an oily substance), bacteria and dead skin cells. Those blockages produce blackheads, whiteheads, nodules and other types of pimples. If you have acne, know you’re not alone. It’s the most common skin condition that people experience. It’s estimated that 80% of people ages 11 to 30 will have at least a mild form of acne, and most people are affected by it at some point in their lives.",What is acne?
"Though it mainly affects teenagers and young adults undergoing hormonal changes, many people continue struggling with acne into their 20s, 30s and beyond. Some even develop acne for the first time as adults.",Who does acne affect?
"The most common spots where you might have acne are your face, forehead, chest, shoulders and upper back. Oil glands are all over your body, but those are the places where there are the most. The best way to treat acne depends on how severe it is. Acne can be mild (a few occasional pimples) moderate (inflammatory papules) or severe (nodules and cysts).",Where does acne most commonly occur?
Acne can take several forms. They include:,What are the different types of acne?
"Acne is largely a hormonal condition that’s driven by androgen hormones, which typically become active during the teenage and young adult years. Sensitivity to these hormones — combined with surface bacteria on the skin and fatty acids within oil glands — can result in acne.",What causes acne?
"Some studies have linked particular foods and diets to acne. Skim milk, whey protein and diets high in sugar may contribute to acne flares. Chocolate has not been directly linked to acne.",Does chocolate cause acne?
"One of the causes of acne is a surge in hormones called androgens (specifically testosterone), which both women and men produce. Those hormones tend to be at their peak during the teen years.",Why do so many teenagers get acne?
"For the most part, hormonal changes in the body drive acne. There is some evidence that skim milk, whey protein and diets high in sugar may cause acne breakouts, although this remains controversial.",Do certain foods cause acne?
"Acne does sometimes result in scarring. It happens when the acne penetrates the skin and damages the deeper layers. Inflammation makes the acne pores swell and breakdown occurs in the wall of the pore. Scarring can, of course, be a source of anxiety, which is normal. But before it can be treated, your healthcare provider will determine what type of acne caused the scars.",Can acne cause scars?
"Your healthcare provider can diagnose acne during a skin exam. They may also ask if you’re undergoing significant stress or if you have a family history of acne, all of which are risk factors. Teenage girls and women may also be asked about their menstrual cycles, as breakouts are sometimes related. Sudden, severe acne outbreaks in older people can sometimes signal another underlying disease that requires medical attention.",How is acne diagnosed?
Dermatologists rank acne by severity:,How severe can acne get?
"Your healthcare provider may suggest some non-prescription medications for your condition. Depending on the condition’s severity, your age, the type of acne you have and how effective the over-the-counter remedies have been, you may need stronger prescription medications.",How is acne treated?
"Your acne can be managed by your general healthcare provider. However, when acne does not improve or is severe you should see a board certified dermatologist.",Do I need to see a specialist?
"Continue washing your face at least daily with lukewarm water and a mild facial cleanser that you can buy over the counter. Products containing benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid are effective. You can also now purchase the topical retinoid, Differin®, over the counter and use as directed.",What should I do while waiting to see a dermatologist?
Preventing acne is difficult if not impossible during normal hormonal changes. But some things can help:,Can acne be prevented?
"Acne often goes away in early adulthood, though some people will continue to experience acne throughout adulthood. Your healthcare provider or board certified dermatologist can help manage this difficult condition.",What can I expect if I’ve been diagnosed with acne?
"Many topical and oral acne treatments are contraindicated during pregnancy. If you’re a woman in your childbearing years, it’s important to discuss acne treatments with your healthcare provider and alert them if you become pregnant. Isotretinoin is known to cause severe birth defects and therefore, two methods of birth control are required while on this medication.",Are there any special concerns for women of childbearing age with acne?
